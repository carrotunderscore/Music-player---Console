AudioPlayer
Work to be done here. I want to be able to input a created sinewave and play that as well as a local audio file. This can be of great use when it comes to tuning.

AudioManipulation
For testing purposes I've created a sine wave that I plot and play the sound of. I do this before segmenting it and applying the Hanning function and afterwards 
to make sure that it works as expected. The sinewave that plays after the hanning window function has lower amplitude which is to be expected.
